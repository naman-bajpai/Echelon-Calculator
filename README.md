Matrix Solver: Final Project
================================================================

This project demonstrates how to input a matrix of numbers, perform row reduction to obtain the row-reduced echelon form, and visualize the results using Flask, matplotlib, and HTML/CSS.


Description
The project consists of a Flask web application that allows users to input a matrix of numbers, perform row reduction to obtain the row-reduced echelon form, and visualize the results on a web page. The visualization is done using matplotlib, and the frontend is built using HTML and CSS.

USAGE 

1. Run the application 
    
Execute the flask_app.py script to start the Flask server:

    make flask

The server will start running locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

2. Input Matrix:
Access the web application using a web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Enter the dimensions of the matrix and input the values.

3. Perform Row Reduction:
Click on the "Solve" button to perform row reduction and obtain the row-reduced echelon form.

4. Visualize Results:
The row-reduced echelon form of the matrix will be displayed on the web page.

Note: The program is a work in progress and may not function properly in its current state. Further improvements are ongoing.
